    """Mixin that makes a publisher remove security proxies.

    This mixin overrides three methods from the `IPublication`
    interface (defined in `zope.publisher.interfaces`) to alter their
    security behavior.  The normal Zope machinery wraps a security
    proxy around the application object returned by
    `getApplication()`, and around each of the objects returned as
    `traverseName()` is then called for each URL component.  The
    versions here strip the security proxy off instead, returning the
    bare object (unless the object is a non-Grok view, in which case
    we leave the proxy installed for important security
    reasons).  Non-Grok views however, are handled like Grok views, if
    they provide `grokcore.view.IGrokSecurityView`.

    Finally, when `callObject()` is asked to render
    the view, we quickly re-install a security proxy on the object, make
    sure that the current user is indeed allowed to invoke `__call__()`,
    then pass the bare object to the rendering machinery.

    The result is that, in place of the elaborate series of security
    checks made during the processing of a normal Zope request, Grok
    makes only a single security check: to see if the view can be
    permissibly rendered or not.
